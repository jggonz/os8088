"""cs_pwhole NEVER LIES: no vertex is behind when the object says it is whole
(SPEC.md 88.5.11), on MartyPC.

    python3 tests/skiesrad.py [--clobber-rad]

Reported off the machine: *"in building/ground wire mode, with otherwise max
settings, sometimes lines will draw across the cockpit."*

`cs_projall` predicts, from `CSM_RAD`, that an object is wholly in front of
the near plane, and two fast paths are built on that prediction being true:
`cs_edge1` opens `cmp byte [cs_pwhole],0 / jne .both` and reads
`cs_sxv`/`cs_syv` WITHOUT testing `cs_fv`, and `.conv` sets `cs_pinview` off
a box taken from the projected vertices, which turns `cs_seg`'s clip off
entirely. A vertex that took `.behind` has no `cs_sxv` this frame - the slot
still holds whatever the last object to use that index left in it - so the
edge is drawn from a real vertex to a stale one with no clip, and it goes
wherever that stale coordinate is.

**THE INVARIANT IS THE ASSERTION AND THE PIXELS ARE NOT**, deliberately.
Whether a line actually lands on the cockpit depends on what the previous
object happened to leave in the slot, so the symptom is intermittent by
construction - it showed on 1 of 80 poses swept around the Shard. A row that
asserted the pixels would go green on a broken build four times in five.
What is exact, and true at the moment the frame is drawn, is this: if
`cs_pwhole` is set then every `cs_fv` is 1.

The Shard is the model to fly at - 306 m, a `CS_PYR`, the tallest thing in
any world - and the pose is a dive past it, which is what puts its apex
behind the near plane while its base is comfortably in front.

--clobber-rad is the red run (docs/WRITING-TESTS.md 1) and restores BOTH
halves of the defect, because either alone is enough to hide it: the Shard's
CSM_RAD goes back to the 209 that `wx + wz + h / 2` gave it, and 88.5.11.1's
five-byte `mov byte [cs_pwhole],0` in `.behind` is NOPped out.
