"""NOTHING IN ANY WORLD STANDS IN ITS OWN WATER (SPEC.md 88.6.3).

The Eiffel Tower's object sat at the map's origin, and the tower's base is
124 m across: one corner of it was 15.7 m inside the near bank of
`cs_m_rivc0`, and from the air the tower was drawn dipping into the river.
The object moved 60 m back along that bank's normal (§88.6.3) - and the
next person to move either the tower or a river piece has no way of
noticing they have put it back, because the two are declared 200 lines
apart in `csworld.inc` and neither mentions the other.

So this walks the world as the game reads it: the object table and the
models are decoded out of `build/skies.bin`, at the offsets the package's
own equates give, and every collidable building's ground footprint is held
against every river polygon. Host-side, no emulator, one second.

SINCE 88.6.4 THERE ARE NINE LOCATIONS AND SEVEN WORLDS, so it walks them
all: the location table `cs_ports` is the list, and each row's CSA_OBJS and
CSA_NOBJ name the world it stands in. Two locations sharing one world (the
two Paris runways do) are walked once. A world with no water is reported
and skipped, which is not a pass it earned - it is a world with nothing for
this gate to say.

It is deliberately about the WATER and not about buildings overlapping each
other: two blocks sharing a corner is a skyline, and a basilica standing in
a river is a bug.
