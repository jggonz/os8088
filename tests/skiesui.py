"""CLEAR SKIES' title page (SPEC.md 88.10) and the drop-down it is the first
user of (SPEC.md 13.14), driven on MartyPC's VGA machine.

    python3 tests/skiesui.py [--machine os8088_xt_vga]

The VGA machine, because it is the one with a CHOICE of fullscreen mode and
so the one with a Mode menu; everything else here is the same on the three
adapters. Every position comes off the package's own records - the
drop-downs' rects are written by the painter in screen coordinates, so a
click at a rect's centre is a click on the control wherever the window
landed - and every answer is read out of the package's bss, not the glass.

  1. the plane list DROPS on a press in its box, and a press anywhere else
     takes it down without picking (OS88UI_DR_OPEN);
  2. the location list drops, and a press on its second item PICKS it:
     OS88UI_DR_SEL = 1, cs_airport = the second airport's record, and
     cs_inited = 0 so the next flight starts on that runway;
  3. Esc takes an open list down;
  4. Flight -> Instructions turns the page (cs_page = 1) and a click turns it
     back;
  5. the Mode row - on the Settings page since SPEC.md 88.13, and gone from
     the bar - offers Mode X and CGA, its pick lands (cs_modepref, cs_want)
     and F then flies in CGA320 (cs_back = 2), the frame counter climbing;
  6. after all of that the menu bar still drops.

Check 2a is the drop-down's SAVE-UNDER (SPEC.md 13.14.1): opening the list
banks the pixels it covers and closing it writes them back, so the band the
list lay over must come back pixel for pixel, with the claim released. The
pointer is parked at one place for both captures, which is what lets the
comparison be exact rather than approximate.

Check 2 also reads the kernel's `ui_armw` between the pick's PRESS and its
RELEASE, and that word must name the launcher's own window (cs_win). It is
the check that would have caught the first build: its click handler came
back with SI pointing at the airport record it had picked, ui_task armed
the release to THAT as the window (SPEC.md 13.7, `mov [ui_armw], si` after
W_ONCLICK returns), and the release far-called through whatever kernel
bytes sat at that offset - an unmapped segment, that time. The launcher
looked fine; the bar died three seconds later. What the release does with
a wrong arm depends on the bytes it finds, so the row reads the ARM and
not the wreckage.

--clobber-si is the red run (docs/WRITING-TESTS.md 1): it patches the two
`pop si` that put SI back - the click handler's and the pick's - into
`pop bp`, which is the first build's bug exactly, and check 2 must then
read the airport record where the window should be.
