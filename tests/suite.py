"""The test registry - what runs, in which tier, and why.

`tools/os88test.py` reads this and nothing else.  Adding a test is adding a
row here; a test that is not in this file does not run in any tier, which is
the state all ninety of them were in before it existed.

THE THREE TIERS.

  fast   Budget 30s. Host-side only - it reads what `make` just built and
         checks the invariants that break SILENTLY. Hangs off the default
         build, so it cannot be skipped.

  full   Budget 10 minutes. THE PRE-MERGE GATE. fast, plus the build matrix
         `all` never builds, plus a CURATED set of emulator tests.

  soak   No budget. Everything else - the rest of `tests/`, which is a great
         deal and is where the deep single-subject gates live.

WHY `full` IS CURATED AND NOT "ALL OF THEM", which is the thing to understand
before adding a row to it.  Measured on a cycle-accurate 5150 in a container:
a MartyPC boot to a settled desktop is **7.8 seconds**, and the emulator tests
in `tests/` run **40-75 seconds each** because each one boots its own machine
and then drives a session through it.  They also cannot run in parallel -
every one of them drives the debug server on 127.0.0.1:9001, one port, one
connection, and a second client does not error, it HANGS (docs/MARTYPC-DEBUG.md).

So 10 minutes is about **eight** emulator tests, not fifty.  That is not a
limitation to be engineered away - it is what the machine costs - and the
honest response is to say which eight and put the rest in `soak` where they
are still one command away (`os88test.py soak -k disp*`).  The runner FAILS
the tier when it overruns, so this stays true as rows are added rather than
drifting until the suite is too slow to run.

WHAT EARNS A `full` ROW.  Breadth per second, and independence.  `bootsmoke`
is the model: eight seconds, and it exercises the boot sector, FAT12, the
`int 13h` splitter, adapter detection, the heap ladder, `drv_boot` and the
first paint - so it fails for almost any serious regression, wherever it was.
A row that can only fail for one narrowly-scoped reason belongs in `soak`,
next to the change that would break it.
