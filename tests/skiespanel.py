"""THE PANEL'S TWO HALVES (SPEC.md 88.9.4): sampled on the gate, painted per
PAGE - on MartyPC, on Mode X, which is the only backend with two pages.

    python3 tests/skiespanel.py [--machine os8088_xt_vga]

The gate is in TICKS and the page is the frame's PARITY, so a gate frame
lands on whichever page happens to be current. When the same read served
both, the other page kept whatever it last had - and the altimeter read
1,683 feet one frame and 1,666 the next, for ever, which is what the owner
saw. The reading is latched into one shared set now and each page's own
cache decides whether it still needs painting.

  1. in a steady climb the DISPLAYED sequence - the page each frame drew,
     read after it - never goes backwards, and it does not stand still
     either;
  2. the labels are drawn with the cockpit and not with the readings, so a
     panel that has never been repainted still says SPD/ALT/HDG/THR;
  3. and the STATE box says which state (88.9.4.1). cs_k_state packs the
     state, the stall and cs_onwater into one word so the box repaints when
     a hull leaves the water; cs_d_state tested the whole of the high byte
     for the stall, and an amphibian airborne OFF the water - which is how
     every A5 flight starts - read STALLED for the whole flight.

THE TWO PAGES' CACHES ARE NOT THE CHECK, and were tried as one first: in
both arms they sit about one gate apart, because the gate lands on
alternating pages either way. What differs is whether the page about to be
SHOWN carries the latest reading.

--clobber-share is the red run (docs/WRITING-TESTS.md 1): it sends the
between-gates path back to `.same`, which is the code exactly as it was, and
check 1 must go red. --clobber-state puts cs_d_state's stall test back to the
whole composite byte - `or ah, ah` for `test ah, 1` - and check 3 must go red
on the two rows where the hull is off the water.
