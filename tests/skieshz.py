"""THE HORIZON REACHES THE GLASS (SPEC.md 88.3.3.1), on MartyPC.

    python3 tests/skieshz.py [--machine os8088_5150_herc_gla]

The field reported a horizon that would not turn - *"it just stays stable;
if I change my bank angle it will draw only at SOME of the bank angles"* -
and wedges of ground that came and went with the bank.

cs_skyground was right the whole time: pinned at 45 degrees its cs_xl reads
a correct diagonal and at 90 a vertical line where the arithmetic puts it.
The band's rows were drawn into the SHADOW and never carried to the glass,
because the band loop wrote each split row's span and never widened the
span set's ROW RANGE - and 88.3.3's range is the only thing cs_blit walks.

So the row checks the GLASS, not the arithmetic, against the guest's own
[cs_nx]/[cs_ny]/[cs_nz]: sky is where the ray r = (X/sclx, -Y/scly, 1) has
r.n > 0 (88.4.1), and everything else is the fill being wrong.

Two things make it a real test rather than a plausible one. It PINS the
attitude, which is what makes the failure reachable at all - a pinned world
is one where no row changes kind and no object marks anything, so nothing
else widens the range. And it compares over GROUPS OF FOUR ROWS, because
the Hercules ground is 0x88 00 22 00 and two of its four phases are blank:
a per-row test calls half the ground sky and passes on a broken build.

AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN ONE MODE ALONG (SPEC.md 88.13.3.1), so
there is a second check. With the ground fill OFF the two sides are both
black on a 1bpp adapter and what tells them apart is ONE SEGMENT - and the
field reported it *"disappearing at some angles, some of the time"*.
`cs_skyground` runs BEFORE `cs_scene`, so all three of the words `cs_seg`
reads about its caller are the PREVIOUS frame's last object's: `cs_pinview`
skips the clip, `cs_pwhole` skips the marking, and `cs_markacc` accumulates
into an object box `cs_drawobj` resets a moment later. The segment was drawn
into the shadow and never carried, exactly as the band's rows were.

Check 2 is the GLASS again, and it is an A/B on the segment's own draw: the
`je` that gates it is turned into a `jmp`, and the difference between the
two views is precisely the horizon's blitted pixels. What it is held to is
the host's own Liang-Barsky clip of the same segment against the same view,
so a pose where the horizon genuinely does not cross the view expects
nothing and a pose where it does expects a length.

--clobber-range is the red run for check 1 (docs/WRITING-TESTS.md 1): it
NOPs the two stores that widen the range and nothing else, which is the code
as it was. --clobber-hzmark is check 2's, and puts back all four stores'
worth of leftover.
